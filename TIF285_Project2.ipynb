In addition, the trajectories that are shown in the paper seem to be ones for which the model works very well).\n",

    "### Suggestions for how to proceed:\n",
    "* Follow the lead of the demo notebook for using tensorflow / keras (plus see the hints below).\n",
    "* First download and load the data set and the ANN from the paper (both available on the Canvas course page. Navigate to Files > Project2; see hint below)\n",
    "* It is suggested (but not required) to create helper functions (see hints below): \n",
    "  * `get_data` for extracting a trajectory (positions of particle 1 as a function of the discrete time) from the data; \n",
    "  * `get_trajectories` for generating the positions of all particles from a prediction output that contains the arrays of the first two particles' positions; \n",
    "  * `plot_trajectories` for plotting a trajectory.\n",
    "* When creating your own ANN it is suggested that you first design a smaller one than in the paper (e.g., using five dense layers with 64 neurons in each) and analyse how it performs by looking at the training vs validation error. The creation of a large network with ten layers and 128 nodes per layer is optional (and might require more cpu-hours for training).\n",
    "* Try first with the `relu` activation function and the `Adam` optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and moments of 0.5 (these hyper-parameters can easily be changed if you want; see hints below). \n",
    "    - The choice of optimizer  and hyper-parameters such as learning rate can certainly influence your results. For the interested, an extensive guide with open-source experimental results is published here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01547.\n",
    "* Use 90% of the data for training and 10% for validation. You probably need at least hundred epochs for training and it is suggested to split the data into 10-100 batches (see hints below)."

    "* Download the pre-trained ANN model `Breen_NN_project2.keras` and load it with: `pre_trained_model = keras.models.load_model(\"Breen_NN_project2.keras\")`. This file should also be included in the gzipped tarball that contains the project 2 files.\n",
    "  *Please let us know if you have difficulties loading this model as there might be compatibility issues between different `tensorflow` versions. As a backup, the weights of Breen's model are stored in `Breen_NN_project2.weights.h5` and can be loaded using the `load_weights()` method into a network of the correct topology (10 hidden layers of width 128; relu activation).*\n",
    "* The ANN input should be an array with three elements: $[t,x_2,y_2]$, where the last two will be the initial position of particle 2 and the first one is the time step for which the particle positions should be predicted. Remember that particle 1 always starts in $(1,0)$. \n",
    "* Input data corresponding to a single trajectory is then of shape $1000 \\times 3$ where the first column contains the time steps while the $x_2,y_2$ columns are repetitions of the initial position.\n",
    "* I.e., the inputs to the `tensorflow` network is a tensor with three columns where the second and third columns have values that are repeated (with values of the initial position at [t=0]) for all the rows corresponding to a single trajectory.\n",
    "* The output should be an array with four elements $[x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2]$ that corresponds to the positions of particles 1 and 2 at the time step $t$ that was given in the first position of the input. Again, we can consider a tensor (batch) of outputs corresponding, e.g., to a full trajectory.\n",
    "* As mentioned, some of the trajectories contain collisions such that the positions of the particles get stuck at (0, 0). Check the data to find those trajectories and remove them before training your model.\n",
    "* The data can be turned into a `tensorflow` dataset using: `dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y))`, where `x` and `y` are input and output data, respectively (you might possibly need to reshape using `x.reshape(-1, 3)` and `y.reshape(-1, 4)`)\n",
    "* Having created a dataset, e.g. `train_dataset`, you can make batches (e.g. with batchsize 5000) with `train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(5000)`. The same should then be done for the validation data. As mentioned, the trajectories are represented by data points in sets of 1000 (time steps). While creating batches of data, make sure you are not mixing part of the data from one trajectory with a different trajectory. \n",
    "* When compiling a `tensorflow` model, with `model.compile()`, the Adam optimizer can be specified via the argument `optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001, 0.5, 0.5)`\n",
    "* Furthermore, the loss function can be chosen using the argument `loss=keras.losses.MeanAbsoluteError()`\n",
    "* Fitting the model for 100 epochs with specified training and validation data sets can be performed with: `model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=100, validation_data = val_dataset)`\n",
    "* Given the cost of training the network with all data, it is not required to make extensive tests of tuning the hyperparameters.\n",
    "* More exact timing of a function can be measured using [\"Jupyter notebook magic\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-top-5-magic-commands-for-jupyter-notebooks-2bf0c5ae4bb8) by putting the command to be measured in a notebook cell that starts with `%timeit`. This will run the cell many times and report the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation time."

    "* You should probably define helper functions that compute potential energies, velocities and kinetic energies for points along a trajectory. Note that the masses start from rest.\n",

    "* You can define a **custom loss function** that assumes a batch size that is equal to the number of time steps in a trajectory. You should also make sure that the data is not shuffled so that a **batch always corresponds to a trajectory**. Then you can use a **global time array** to be used to extract velocities and therefore kinetic energies.\n",

A suggestion is to clip very large values of `energy_error` in the return statement of the custom energy loss by `tf.clip_by_value(energy_error, -1e6, 1e6)`. \n",
