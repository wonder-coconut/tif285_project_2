    "* First download and load the data set and the ANN from the paper (both available on the Canvas course page. Navigate to Files > Project2; see hint below)\n",
    "* It is suggested (but not required) to create helper functions (see hints below): \n",
    "  * `get_data` for extracting a trajectory (positions of particle 1 as a function of the discrete time) from the data; \n",
    "  * `get_trajectories` for generating the positions of all particles from a prediction output that contains the arrays of the first two particles' positions; \n",
    "  * `plot_trajectories` for plotting a trajectory.\n",
    "* When creating your own ANN it is suggested that you first design a smaller one than in the paper (e.g., using five dense layers with 64 neurons in each) and analyse how it performs by looking at the training vs validation error. The creation of a large network with ten layers and 128 nodes per layer is optional (and might require more cpu-hours for training).\n",
    "* Try first with the `relu` activation function and the `Adam` optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and moments of 0.5 (these hyper-parameters can easily be changed if you want; see hints below). \n",
    "    - The choice of optimizer  and hyper-parameters such as learning rate can certainly influence your results. For the interested, an extensive guide with open-source experimental results is published here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01547.\n",
    "* Use 90% of the data for training and 10% for validation. You probably need at least hundred epochs for training and it is suggested to split the data into 10-100 batches (see hints below)."

    "  *Please let us know if you have difficulties loading this model as there might be compatibility issues between different `tensorflow` versions. As a backup, the weights of Breen's model are stored in `Breen_NN_project2.weights.h5` and can be loaded using the `load_weights()` method into a network of the correct topology (10 hidden layers of width 128; relu activation).*\n",

    "* The data can be turned into a `tensorflow` dataset using: `dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y))`, where `x` and `y` are input and output data, respectively (you might possibly need to reshape using `x.reshape(-1, 3)` and `y.reshape(-1, 4)`)\n",
    "* Having created a dataset, e.g. `train_dataset`, you can make batches (e.g. with batchsize 5000) with `train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(5000)`. The same should then be done for the validation data. As mentioned, the trajectories are represented by data points in sets of 1000 (time steps). While creating batches of data, make sure you are not mixing part of the data from one trajectory with a different trajectory. \n",
    "* When compiling a `tensorflow` model, with `model.compile()`, the Adam optimizer can be specified via the argument `optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001, 0.5, 0.5)`\n",
    "* Furthermore, the loss function can be chosen using the argument `loss=keras.losses.MeanAbsoluteError()`\n",
    "* Fitting the model for 100 epochs with specified training and validation data sets can be performed with: `model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=100, validation_data = val_dataset)`\n",
    "* Given the cost of training the network with all data, it is not required to make extensive tests of tuning the hyperparameters.\n",
    "* More exact timing of a function can be measured using [\"Jupyter notebook magic\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-top-5-magic-commands-for-jupyter-notebooks-2bf0c5ae4bb8) by putting the command to be measured in a notebook cell that starts with `%timeit`.

    "* You should probably define helper functions that compute potential energies, velocities and kinetic energies for points along a trajectory. Note that the masses start from rest.\n",
    "* In order to construct a `tensorflow` custom loss you will need `@tf.function()` versions of the same helper functions. Within these you can only use `tensforflow` methods such as: `tf.concat()` and `tf.math.sqrt()` (i.e., `numpy` methods cannot be used for these functions). \n",
    "* See (suggested) `tensorflow` helper functions docstrings below. \n",
    "* You can define a **custom loss function** that assumes a batch size that is equal to the number of time steps in a trajectory. You should also make sure that the data is not shuffled so that a **batch always corresponds to a trajectory**. Then you can use a **global time array** to be used to extract velocities and therefore kinetic energies.\n",
    "* See a suggested structure of the custom loss below. You might get problems with very large kinetic and potential energies for trajectories with close encounters. A suggestion is to clip very large values of `energy_error` in the return statement of the custom energy loss by `tf.clip_by_value(energy_error, -1e6, 1e6)`. \n",
    "* The custom loss is then used in `model.compile()` via the argument `loss=custom_energy_loss`."
